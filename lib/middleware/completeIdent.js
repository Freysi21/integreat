/**
 * Middleware that will complete the identity of the dispatched action.
 *
 * This is done by dispatching a 'GET_IDENT' action to the next middleware, and
 * and then setting the retrieved ident item on the action before passing it
 * on to the next middleware. If an ident item cannot be found or the request
 * results in an error, the original action will simply be passed on.
 *
 * As the 'GET_IDENT' action is not passed to the entire middleware chain, but
 * only to the middlewares after this one, you should take care when you decide
 * on the order of middlewares. E.g., by placing completeIdent before any
 * caching middleware, you'll get caching of ident items for free. It is also
 * good practice to place it after any queueing middleware, so that the ident
 * completion happens when the action is pulled from the queue. This way, you
 * make sure that the ident has not lost it's permissions between queueing and
 * final dispatch.
 *
 * @param {function} next - The next middleware
 * @returns {function} The middleware function, accepting an action as only arg
